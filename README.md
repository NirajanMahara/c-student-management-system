Project | Student Record Management System In C language | File Handling </b>
<br>
-----------------
The mini-project “Student Record System Project in C” is a console application using the C programming language. This project compiled in DEV C++ with the GCC compiler.
In this console application, we can do basic Student Record tasks like 
- adding the student info,
- view the added students,
- search the students using name only,
- modifying records using name only,
- deleting records of student using name only,
- ..etc.
--------

## Also to increase the readability, I have broken the application in different functions.
<b>
- void gotoxy(int, int); <br>
- void menu(); <br>
- void add(); <br>
- void view(); <br>
- void search(); <br>
- void modify(); <br>
- void deleterec(); <br>
</b>
<br>
Each function of the project extensively use in the file handing function, so it is also a great project to understand file handling in C.
